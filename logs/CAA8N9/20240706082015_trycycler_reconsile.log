[2m    Trycycler now compares the contigs to each other to repair any[0m
[2mcircularisation issues. After this step, each sequence should be cleanly[0m
[2mcircularised - i.e. the first base in the contig immediately follows the last[0m
[2mbase. Each contig will be circularised by looking for the position of its start[0m
[2mand end in the other contigs. If necessary, additional sequence will be added[0m
[2mor duplicated sequence will be removed. If there are multiple possible ways to[0m
[2mfix a contig's circularisation, then Trycycler will use read alignments to[0m

Contigs have passed the initial check - they seem sufficiently close to reconcile.

[2m    In this step, Trycycler ensures that all sequences are on the same strand.[0m
[2mIt does this by first finding a sequence that occurs once in each contig and[0m
[2mthen flipping any of the contigs (converting to their reverse complement[0m
[2msequence) which have this sequence on the negative strand.[0m

[2m    Trycycler now compares the contigs to each other to repair any[0m
[2mcircularisation issues. After this step, each sequence should be cleanly[0m
[2mcircularised - i.e. the first base in the contig immediately follows the last[0m
[2mbase. Each contig will be circularised by looking for the position of its start[0m
[2mand end in the other contigs. If necessary, additional sequence will be added[0m
[2mor duplicated sequence will be removed. If there are multiple possible ways to[0m
[2mfix a contig's circularisation, then Trycycler will use read alignments to[0m
[2mchoose the best one.[0m

Circularising H_contig_1:
  using I_contig_3:
    unable to circularise: H_contig_1's start/end is the same as I_contig_3's start/end
  using K_contig_1:
    unable to circularise: H_contig_1's start/end is the same as K_contig_1's start/end

Error: failed to circularise sequence H_contig_1 because it had the same
start/end as the other sequences. I.e. the circularisations were not different
and therefore could not reconcile each other.
