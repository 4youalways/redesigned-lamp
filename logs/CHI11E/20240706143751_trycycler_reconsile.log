[2m    In this step, Trycycler ensures that all sequences are on the same strand.[0m
[2mIt does this by first finding a sequence that occurs once in each contig and[0m

[2mcircularised - i.e. the first base in the contig immediately follows the last[0m

[2m    In this step, Trycycler ensures that all sequences are on the same strand.[0m
[2mIt does this by first finding a sequence that occurs once in each contig and[0m
[2mthen flipping any of the contigs (converting to their reverse complement[0m
